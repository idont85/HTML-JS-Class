        <h1>idont85's Coding Projects</h1>
        <p>Hi, my username is idont85, and this is my project page. This is where I will store random projects I thought up of or wanted to do! I am hosting this on a Github server because, alas I am just to poor to afford my own domains! As I learn more coding skills, I will frequently update this page to look and function better and better. Hi me in the future looking at this! The coding languages that I currently know are, Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript!</p>
